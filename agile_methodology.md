# Introduction

We do not define our we do work as our processes are changing too much nowadays to log it.

### Agile metholody
We can consider we are doing our own agile method.

Agile is meant to leave technical decisions to the technical people.

12 principles in [Agile Software Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) reflects quite well Misakey's philosophy:
- self-organized teams
- flexible requirements
- continuous delivery
- simplicity

# Sprint Review
_The goal of a Sprint Review is to summarize what has been done or reported during the sprint. Here We talk here about functional progress and rarely technical according to the audience. It happens at the end of a sprint._

Type of attendees: Misakey Product/Technical Team, Internal/External Stakeholders...

Technical/Feature teams should express turn by turn:
## Step 1: Objectives reminder
We remind what was the initial objectives of the sprint.

## Step 2: What has been accomplished (macro)
What has been done during this sprint - we talk here about issues that have been closed.
What has been done additionally to what has been initially defined.

## Step 3: What had not been done (micro)
What has been not done during the sprint, the why (time, deprioritized...), or how far the task is reported in the future.

## Step 4: Demo
Demo should be prepared in advance before the sprint planning. All what is shown in demo is available on production with next release.

# Retrospective
Sometimes, we do retrospectives:
_The goal of a retrospective is to summarize good and bad things that occurred during the sprint. Here we discuss about individual and team feedback about internal process, project state..._

Type of attendees: Misakey Product/Technical Team.

## Step 1: Previous action plans
Check previous action plans have been done, if not discuss about it and its potential postpone.

## Step 2: Writing down
Everyone write on post-its, into 4 categories:
* Happy
* Sad
* Frustrated
* Questions / Facts

## Step 3: Presentation
Everyone presents its Post-its one by one.
We don't comment it, ask questions or give feedback about it. It will be done if the post-its receive a certain amount of vote later.

## Step 4: Answer questions
Answer to every facts/questions asked in step 2.

## Step 5: Votes
Everyone can vote for up to 3 post-its they want to discuss/highlight.

## Step 6: Discussion
We talk more in details about post-its with the highest number of votes within the remaining time.
Either people who voted for it asks questions about it, either people who did write the post-its elaborate, or both.

The output of this discussion is in general one or many action plans. Each action plan should have someone responsible for it and reported at each retrospective if not done.
Sometimes, we don't need action plans since the post-it is just a fact and don't need to necessary have a follow-up.
