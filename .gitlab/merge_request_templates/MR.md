## Summary/TL;DR
> Write shortest possible summary of issue


---
## Close issues
> * List all issues to close when MR is merged.
> * To trigger auto close, link issues preceded by "Closes". See [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)


---
## Detailed description
> * Description should explain briefly how it works / what it does
> * Write detailed and formated sentences for better readability. For instance, use line breaks and bullet lists
> * Instead of copying description from technical issue, write only extra/missing information
> * You can link to ~Spec issue(s) if it helps


---
## Screenshots|Schemas|Code samples
> Paste json schemas/examples when related to API or Data model


---
## :boom: :rotating_light: Breaking changes
> Remove block and title if no breaking change


---
## :exclamation: Tips
> Do not forget to add labels

> Remove all blockquotes when template is filled

/wip
> Wip status signals that this MR is not ready for review yet. Remove wip status only after all conditions are passed

> When MR is created, `Cut/Paste` "Removing wip status" section from description and insert a comment with it.

> Use `// @FIXME` as a comment over code you didn't have time to optimize/improve and think it should be tracked and changed later

> When reviewing, Copy/Paste "Review checklist" and insert a comment describing your review

> When reviewing, if prerequisites are not all OK, just postpone your review and ping back the assignee
