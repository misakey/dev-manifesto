# Slider

## What is it ?

The Frontend Slider is there to store tasks:
- 100% frontend
- with no deadline requirement
- easy to be treated during dev
- to handle when workload gets lighter
- to handle when we work on related subjects

Example: UX/UI subjects (low cost, cool value) prefectly fit in.

## Creating a Slider issue

When we create a Slider issue we are responsible for completing it and making sure anyone can work on it.

## Labels (all labels [here](practices.md#labels))

Primordial labels:
- `Status: draft` (my issue is not ready to be worked on)
- `Owner: X` (who is knowledgeable for questions, for instance the person that found the bug / proposed the improvement)
- `★` (for priority, do not hesitate to change priority)


Helpful labels for devs:
- `Cat: X` (to precise subject)
- `•` (following complexity rules defined in [practices](practices.md#frontend-slider))


## Practices

### Assign / Ping

It's fine to ping or assign people with more knowledge if you need them to add information to your issue.

### [Communication](practices.md#communication)

On slider issues with high complexity `>=•••◦◦`, make sure everyone is aware of the issue.
